This version only work for the new UI of Facebook desktop, it won't work for other UI versions. We'll need to collect your UI specifics then update our selectors, you please download your current https://www.facebook.com/ webpage and save into a `.html` file, then give it to us by attaching in an issue. Other people (maybe me) will try the best to support your Facebook UI asap.

Looking forward to seeing your Issues and PRs.
